# checkers_playing_intelligent_agent

### Project Description: 
- Checkers environment: rules of the game including legal moves and winning state
- Intelligent Agent competes against a Naïve agent
- Intelligent agent uses the Minimax Algorithm to decide on the best next move
- Naïve agent makes random legal moves
- Heuristic: Board evaluation score = # of white pieces - # of black pieces, kings are worth 2
My program has different specifications compared to other AI checkers agents online:
- Mandatory captures, even for the Naïve agent
- Implemented lots of print statements and checks to ensure Minimax algorithm and other recursive functions are working correctly in the background
- Mapped out Minimax algorithm tree diagram to ensure results returned are as expected
